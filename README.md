# Hui Waa

Hui Waa is a place for ocean paddlers of the world to look for wind, swell, tides and weather information for their preferred location.  The MVP version of this project will just be an input field for a location, along with a series of graphs to display an easily readable form of weather data.  At it's highest level, I hope for this project to be a place to track race schedules for many racing organizations, a place for paddlers to maintain favorite downwind runs for a quick weather check, and potentially a forum for sharing information for the paddling community.
